# Notifier

Notifier allows users to 'watch' a page or topic and sends them an email when
a new comment or post was added.

## Features

* Allows subscription to several content areas
* Allows auto-subscribe to your own content, according to user preferences.
* Receive automatic notification by email of new content, including a summary of 
  the newly posted content and links to see the content on-site or unsubscribe.
* Emails can be sent immediately or as a daily, weekly or monthly digest, 
  according to user preferences.
* User preferences can be configured for each content area.
* Assigns template tags for quick subscribe/unsubscribe in content areas.
* Includes standalone overview of subscriptions and user preferences.
* Emails can be in HTML or plain text, according to user preferences. 
* HTML email requires a custom plugin which uses CoTemplate and Emogrifier to 
  automatically generate cross-platform HTML emails with inline styles.
* Includes default HTML email templates based on HTML Email Boilerplate.
